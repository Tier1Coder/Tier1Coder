<h1>💫 About Me:</h1>
  
Hi there, my name is Oskar.  

I have already fulfilled many of my dreams, but even more await me.  
New things fill me with enthusiasm. My attitude is can-do, no matter what.  

The quote of my life is:  
"A patient man will tear for a time, and afterward joy shall spring up unto him."
